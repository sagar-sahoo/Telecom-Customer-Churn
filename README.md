# Telecom-Customer-Churn

Note: The Notebook includes PLOTLY Plots, hence to best view the Notebook I would request you to dowbload the notebook and then open to view the Visualizations.

#Context
"Predict behavior to retain customers. We can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs."

#Content
Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.

The data set includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents


Here, I did EDA to better understand the data and features. Thereafter I used Logistic Regression to predict Customer Churn and understand the key features responsible for customer churn.
